## A *Suits* statistics each season.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
```

#### Calculate statistics for each season
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ratings_data <- read_csv('Suits Rating.csv')
ratings_data <- ratings_data[,-1]
ratings_long <- pivot_longer(ratings_data, cols = starts_with("Season"), 
                             names_to = "Season", values_to = "Rating", 
                             names_prefix = "Season")

ratings_summary <- ratings_long %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  summarise(
    Average_Rating = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Rating = median(Rating, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max_Rating = max(Rating, na.rm = TRUE),
    Min_Rating = min(Rating, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Rating = sd(Rating, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
ratings_summary

```

#### Generate a chart of ratings changes for each season
```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ratings_long <- ratings_long %>%
  mutate(Episode = row_number())

ggplot(ratings_long, aes(x = Episode, y = Rating, group = Season, color = Season)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Ratings Change per Episode for Each Season",
       x = "Episode Number",
       y = "Rating")
